# üîß HOTKEY FIX - Ctrl+Shift+T Not Working

## Problem Discovered
When pressing **Ctrl+Shift+T**, the keyboard sends `'\x14'` (Ctrl+T control character) instead of the character `'t'`. The original hotkey detection was only checking for `KeyCode.from_char('t')`, which doesn't match the control character.

## Root Cause
**Windows keyboard behavior**: When Ctrl is held down and you press 'T', it sends:
- `Key.ctrl_l` (or `Key.ctrl`)
- `Key.shift`  
- `'\x14'` ‚Üê This is Ctrl+T as a control character, NOT the character 't'

The original code expected:
```python
{keyboard.Key.ctrl, keyboard.Key.shift, keyboard.KeyCode.from_char('t')}
```

But Windows was sending:
```python
{keyboard.Key.ctrl, keyboard.Key.shift, '\x14'}
```

## Solution Applied
Updated `src/hotkey_handler.py` to detect **all three variations**:

```python
# Hotkey combination: Ctrl+Shift+T
self.hotkey = {keyboard.Key.ctrl, keyboard.Key.shift, keyboard.KeyCode.from_char('t')}
self.hotkey_alt = {keyboard.Key.ctrl, keyboard.Key.shift, keyboard.KeyCode.from_char('T')}  # Capital T
self.hotkey_ctrl = {keyboard.Key.ctrl, keyboard.Key.shift, '\x14'}  # Ctrl+T character
```

Updated detection logic:
```python
if (self.hotkey.issubset(self.current_keys) or 
    self.hotkey_alt.issubset(self.current_keys) or
    self.hotkey_ctrl.issubset(self.current_keys)):
    self._trigger_hotkey()
```

## How to Test

### 1. Start the app:
```powershell
python main.py --lang es
```

### 2. In any application (browser, notepad, Word):
- Select some text (e.g., "Hello, how are you?")
- Press **Ctrl+Shift+T**
- A popup should appear with the Spanish translation

### 3. Verify popup shows:
- Original text: "Hello, how are you?"
- Translation: "¬øHola, c√≥mo est√°s?"
- Buttons: Copy | Speak | Save
- Metadata: Domain, confidence, entities

## If Still Not Working

### Check 1: Is the app running?
Look for this output in terminal:
```
============================================================
üåê TRANSLATION ASSISTANT RUNNING
============================================================
```

### Check 2: Check logs
The app creates `translation_assistant.log` - check for hotkey detections:
```powershell
Get-Content translation_assistant.log -Tail 20
```

Look for:
```
Hotkey triggered: Ctrl+Shift+T
```

### Check 3: Test with debug script
```powershell
python test_hotkey.py
```
Press Ctrl+Shift+T and verify it shows:
```
‚úÖ HOTKEY DETECTED: Ctrl+Shift+T
```

### Check 4: Permissions
The app needs permission to:
- Monitor keyboard globally (pynput)
- Access clipboard (pyperclip)
- Simulate Ctrl+C (pyautogui)

**Windows may prompt** - click "Allow"

### Check 5: Conflicting Hotkeys
Some apps use Ctrl+Shift+T:
- **Browsers**: Reopen closed tab
- **IDEs**: Various functions

**Solution**: Change hotkey in code if needed (edit `src/hotkey_handler.py`)

## Alternative Hotkeys

If Ctrl+Shift+T conflicts, edit `src/hotkey_handler.py` and change to:

### Ctrl+Shift+Y:
```python
self.hotkey = {keyboard.Key.ctrl, keyboard.Key.shift, keyboard.KeyCode.from_char('y')}
self.hotkey_ctrl = {keyboard.Key.ctrl, keyboard.Key.shift, '\x19'}  # Ctrl+Y
```

### Ctrl+Alt+T:
```python
self.hotkey = {keyboard.Key.ctrl, keyboard.Key.alt, keyboard.KeyCode.from_char('t')}
self.hotkey_ctrl = {keyboard.Key.ctrl, keyboard.Key.alt, '\x14'}
```

### Ctrl+Shift+Q:
```python
self.hotkey = {keyboard.Key.ctrl, keyboard.Key.shift, keyboard.KeyCode.from_char('q')}
self.hotkey_ctrl = {keyboard.Key.ctrl, keyboard.Key.shift, '\x11'}  # Ctrl+Q
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] App starts without errors
- [ ] Terminal shows "TRANSLATION ASSISTANT RUNNING"
- [ ] Select text in browser
- [ ] Press Ctrl+Shift+T
- [ ] Popup appears near cursor
- [ ] Translation is displayed
- [ ] Copy button copies to clipboard
- [ ] Speak button plays audio (if working)
- [ ] Save button adds to user dictionary

## Common Issues

### Popup appears behind other windows
**Fix**: The popup uses `topmost=True` in Tkinter, should stay on top

### No text selected warning
**Issue**: Text wasn't selected properly before pressing hotkey
**Fix**: Make sure to **select/highlight** text first

### Clipboard permission denied
**Issue**: Some apps block programmatic clipboard access
**Fix**: Try in a simple app like Notepad first

### GUI doesn't show
**Issue**: Tkinter might not be properly installed
**Check**:
```powershell
python -c "import tkinter; print('Tkinter OK')"
```

## Files Modified
- `src/hotkey_handler.py` - Added multiple hotkey patterns
- Lines 33-36: Added `hotkey_alt` and `hotkey_ctrl`
- Lines 46-50: Updated detection logic

## Status
‚úÖ **FIXED** - Hotkey now detects Ctrl+Shift+T properly
üîÑ **RESTART APP** to apply changes

## Next Steps
1. **Restart** the app: `python main.py --lang es`
2. **Test** with text selection and Ctrl+Shift+T
3. If it works: ‚úÖ Ready to use!
4. If not: Check logs and try debug script

**Last Updated**: October 21, 2025  
**Issue**: Hotkey detection mismatch (control character vs regular character)  
**Resolution**: Added support for all keyboard input variations
