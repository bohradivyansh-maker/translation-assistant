- ✅ **Status Window:** Visual indicator with Exit button
- ✅ **Minimize Option:** Can hide window while app runs
- ✅ **Graceful Shutdown:** Properly closes all components

## 📝 Technical Implementation

### New Files Created:
- **`src/system_tray.py`** - Status window and exit hotkey handler
- **`USER_GUIDE.md`** - Complete user documentation

### Modified Files:
- **`main.py`** - Integrated system tray and exit handling
- **`build_executable.bat`** - Updated to include new files

### Key Components:
```python
# Exit hotkey listener (Ctrl+Shift+Q)
- Runs in separate thread
- Monitors keyboard for Ctrl+Shift+Q
- Calls graceful shutdown on detection

# Status window (Tkinter)
- Small, unobtrusive window
- Bottom-right positioning
- Can minimize/move
- Exit button for easy closing

# Graceful shutdown
- Stops hotkey listeners
- Closes database connections
- Logs statistics
- Forces clean exit
```

## 🔄 Rebuilding the Executable

After the fix, rebuild with:

```powershell
.\build_executable.bat
```

This creates a new `TranslationAssistant.exe` with exit functionality included.

**The new executable will:**
- Show status window on startup
- Allow `Ctrl+Shift+Q` to exit
- Have Exit button in window
- Close properly without Task Manager
